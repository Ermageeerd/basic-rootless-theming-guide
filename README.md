# Hello!
This repository is a compilation of all Rootless theming things I know.

NOTE: SOME THINGS REQUIRE SHIZUKU

# Change Heads-Up Notifications.

First, run the command below.
```
adb shell settings put global heads_up_notifications_enabled 0
```

Then, install any replacement app. Here are a few:

And there we go!

# Change Volume Panel

This one is much simpler! Unfortunately, I know no FOSS app to do this.

All you need to do is install the app, and follow the instructions!

Then, press "Start".

Done!

Here's the app!
