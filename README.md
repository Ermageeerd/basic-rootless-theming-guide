# Hello!
This repository is a compilation of all Rootless theming things I know.

NOTE: SOME THINGS REQUIRE SHIZUKU

# Change Material You Colors

You need Shizuku to use this app rootlessly, it works.

Open the app, and follow the instructions.

# Change Heads-Up Notifications.

First, run the command below.
```
adb shell settings put global heads_up_notifications_enabled 0
```

Then, install any replacement app. Here are a few:

https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/com.achep.headsup

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamworks.dynamicspot

And there we go!

# Change Volume Panel

This one is much simpler! Unfortunately, I know no FOSS app to do this.

All you need to do is install the app, and follow the instructions!

Then, press "Start".

Done!

Here's the app!

# Change Notification Panel

The worst of the list, the apps that do this usually either require unneeded setup that could be done with Shizuku or don't allow you to tap an area. Or both.

However, it's still rootless theming, so I have to add them.
